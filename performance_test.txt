Discussion:
To start off we get a speed increase from 1 to 2 threads in all test which shows. However when using a smaller test set in this case 10000 3 and 4 threads do not give a speed up and rather a slowdown. This is probably due to the fact that we are using a high cutoff value. If we put the cutoff value lower maybe it would have yielded a better result.
In our implementation we are also using task which may and may not run in parallel. This in turn might result in an uneven load balancing.
There is also a problem with the values we generate. Because the generated values are 0 - 99 it means that many parition may end up with few distinct values which in turn means that the partitions may be unbalanced due to selection of a poor pivot value.
